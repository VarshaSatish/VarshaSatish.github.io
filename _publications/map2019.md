Histological changes in the cancer-free lymph nodes (LNs) can add to the risk prediction of developing distant metastasis for LN-positive breast cancer patients. As Whole Slide Images (WSI) demonstrated suitability for detection of LN metastasis with high accuracy based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we extended the assessments to cancer-free LNs to determine whether early signs of disease progression could be identified.
