<h1>About Me </h1> 
<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Varsha S, a Data Scientist at Nference. I completed my Master's in May 2022 from the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My  Master's thesis was focused on introducing a range of novel deep learning based algorithms that automatically analyse cancerous tissue in H&E histology images. My expertise lies in developing robust supervision techniques for large scale medical image analysis. During my Master's, I was associated with MeDAL (Medical Imaging, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and worked under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. Earlier, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the department of electronics and communication engineering at <a href="https://bmsce.ac.in/home/Electronics-and-Communication-Engineering-About" style="text-decoration: none;">BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore</a> 
<p>  </p>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>I was exposed to the field of research at <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Communication Engineering</a> guided by <a ref="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~rajivs/#/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Rajiv Soundararajan</a>. After my Master's, I had a brief stint at Amazon in the Alexa NLU Department as an Applied Scientist where I worked on adopting a multiâ€‘lingual encoder architecture for meeting latency constraints and minimising cost of NLU models. 

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached the CV Tab.
