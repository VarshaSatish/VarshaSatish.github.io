<h1>About Me </h1> 
<div style='text-align: justify;'> I’m Varsha, an AI/ML engineer with a strong foundation in deep learning, self-supervised representation learning, and large language models (LLMs). I hold Master’s degrees in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin–Madison and Electrical Engineering from IIT Bombay, where I received the Best Master’s Thesis Award.
<p>  </p>
  
<div style='text-align: justify;'> My industry experience spans roles at Amazon and the healthcare AI startup named nference. At Amazon, I worked as an Applied Scientist, optimizing transformer-based multilingual models for low-latency intent classification across Alexa platforms. At nference, I developed encoder-decoder and YOLOv5-based models for tissue localization in histopathology, enabling ML-powered precision medicine. During my time at UW–Madison, I applied supervised learning to MRI data for predicting treatment response in oncology.
<p>  </p>
  
<div style='text-align: justify;'> My research has been published in IEEE biomedical imaging conferences (ISBI, BIBE), focusing on contrastive learning, label noise robustness, and self-supervised learning in medical imaging. I’m proficient in Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow) and experienced in statistical modeling, computer vision, and NLP.
<p>  </p>

<div style='text-align: justify;'> I’m passionate about building scalable ML systems that drive real-world impact and am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to fast-paced teams focused on deploying end-to-end AI solutions.
