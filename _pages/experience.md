<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<ul>
<li><h4><strong> nference, Bangalore, India</strong></h4></li>
<ul>
	<li>Data Scientist <em>(Jan&rsquo;23 &ndash; Till date)</em></li>
	<li>Worked primarily on developing deep learning based solutions to solve challenges in the field of medical imaging, specifically histopathology.</li>
  <li>Designed a segmentation network to localise varied‑stained tissue images (IHC, H&E) at 1x resolution with AUC value of 0.95.</li>
  <li>Engineered a deep learning based solution to segment kidney whole slide images into constituent entities, namely glomeruli, tubules and
vessel, with mean average precision value of 0.7, as a part of kidney diagnosis pipeline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>
	
<li><h4><strong>Amazon, Alexa NLU, Bangalore, India</strong></h4></li>
<ul>
	<li>Applied Scientist <em>(July&rsquo;22 &ndash; Jan&rsquo;23)</em></li>
	<li>Worked on adopting a multi‑lingual encoder architecture for meeting latency constraints and minimising cost of NLU models.</li>
  <li>Performed A/B testing on the new architecture to expose it to small percentage of traffic to analyse the performance before launch.</li>
  <li>Captured metrics like latency, friction to come up with patches to fix the failures iteratively, also calibrated model confidence to reduce false
accepts and false rejects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>

<li><h4><strong>Visual Information Processing Lab, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore</strong></h4> </li>
<ul>
	<li>Research Assistant <em>(July&rsquo;18 &ndash; May&rsquo;19)</em></li>
	<li>Studied the effect of head movement trajectory information of subjects to objective quality assessment problem in the VR videos.</li>
<li>Trained neural networks to use the video frames as well as viewing direction as the input and predict the viewing direction of the next frame
i.e., prediction of head motion trajectory..</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>

<li><h4><strong>Honeywell Aerospace, Bangalore</strong></h4></li>
<ul>
	<li>Intern <em>(Jan&rsquo;18 &ndash; July&rsquo;18)</em></li>
	<li>Developed proof of concept of Trustzone creation and API development for ARM Cortex‑A processors..</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p></p>

<li><h4><strong>Signal Processing, Interpretation and REpresentation (SPIRE) Lab, IISc Bangalore</strong></h4></li>
<ul>
	<li>Research Intern <em>(June&rsquo;16 &ndash; Aug&rsquo;16)</em></li>
	<li>Implemented EM Algorithm in C to optimize an analytically intractable likelihood function ‑ with an aim of reducing latency.</li>
<li>Implemented Distributed EM algorithm on MATLAB, employed when data is generated at several nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
